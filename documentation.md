# About GitHub Apps

## What Are GitHub Apps?

GitHub Apps are tools that extend GitHub's functionality. They can perform actions on GitHub such as:
- Opening issues
- Commenting on pull requests
- Managing projects

They can also respond to GitHub events and trigger actions outside of GitHub.  
For example, a GitHub App can post a message on Slack when an issue is opened on GitHub.

## Finding GitHub Apps

You can discover GitHub Apps on the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace).

## Building Your Own GitHub App

You can also build your own GitHub App.
