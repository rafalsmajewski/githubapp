# üß† Introduction to GitHub Apps

## üöÄ Overview
A **GitHub App** is a type of integration built specifically to interact with GitHub via its **API** and webhooks. Unlike traditional OAuth Apps that act on behalf of a user, **GitHub Apps act on behalf of themselves** and have **granular permissions**, making them more secure and scalable‚Äîespecially for automation, bots, or CI/CD tools.

## 1. üë• Installation
- A GitHub App is installed on an **organization** or **user account**.
- It can be granted access to **specific repositories**.
- Each installation gets a unique **installation ID**.

## 2. ‚öñÔ∏è Permissions
- GitHub Apps request **fine-grained** access‚Äîe.g., read-only access to issues, or write access to pull requests.
- This is much safer than OAuth Apps, which get broad access to everything a user has.

## 3. üîê Authentication
GitHub Apps authenticate using:

- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to identify themselves.
- They exchange this JWT for an **installation access token**, which lets them call GitHub APIs **on behalf of the installation**.

## 4. üì± Webhooks
- GitHub Apps can subscribe to **webhook events** (like `push`, `pull_request`, `issues`).
- They react to changes in repositories (e.g., leave a comment when a PR is opened).

---

## üîß Technical Workflow

1. **App Registration**:
   - You create a GitHub App in your developer settings.
   - Define callback URLs, permissions, and webhook events.

2. **JWT Authentication**:
   - Your app generates a **JWT** (signed using its private key).
   - This is sent to GitHub to prove who the app is.

3. **Access Token Request**:
   - With the JWT, the app asks GitHub for an **installation access token**.
   - This token gives temporary, scoped access to a specific installation's resources.

4. **API Calls**:
   - Using the installation token, the app makes GitHub API requests to perform actions (e.g., open issues, comment on PRs, update files).

5. **Webhook Handling**:
   - GitHub sends webhooks to the app‚Äôs URL when events occur.
   - The app responds accordingly (e.g., triggering a CI build, assigning reviewers).

## üîç Example Difference

### GitHub App:
- You build a bot that automatically comments on pull requests.
- The bot runs outside of GitHub (e.g., on your own server) and responds to webhooks.
- It authenticates as an **app**, not a user.

### GitHub Actions:
- You want tests and deployment to run every time you push code.
- The workflow runs automatically on GitHub infrastructure.
- No external server needed.

---

## üß† When to Use Which?

| You Need...                                  | Use                |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Automation for builds, tests, deployments     | **GitHub Actions** |
| Bots or API-based integrations from outside GitHub | **GitHub App**     |
| SaaS tools that interact with GitHub users    | **GitHub App**     |
| Reactions to repo changes without infrastructure | **GitHub Actions** |

## Summary

- Use **GitHub Apps** when you need to build **external services** that interact with GitHub via API and webhooks.
- Use **GitHub Actions** when you want to **automate internal workflows** like testing, building, or deploying code directly in your repository.

# üöÄ Step-by-step: Using CircleCI as a GitHub App with Python

This guide shows you how to use CircleCI with a Python project, connected to GitHub.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure

```
my-python-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .circleci/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_app.py
```

---

## üß† Python Files Overview

### `app.py`
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Add 1 + 2 =", add(1, 2))
```
**Explanation:**
- Defines a simple `add` function.
- When the script is run directly, it prints the result of `add(1, 2)`.

### `test_app.py`
```python
import unittest
from app import add

class TestApp(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```
**Explanation:**
- Uses Python‚Äôs built-in `unittest` to test the `add` function.
- Runs three test cases to verify the logic.

### `requirements.txt`
```
# No external dependencies for this example
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è `.circleci/config.yml` Explained

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  test:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/python:3.10
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install dependencies
          command: |
            python -m venv venv
            . venv/bin/activate
            pip install --upgrade pip
            pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run:
          name: Run tests
          command: |
            . venv/bin/activate
            python -m unittest discover

workflows:
  version: 2
  test_workflow:
    jobs:
      - test
```

### üîç Explanation:
- `version: 2.1` ‚Äì defines config version.
- `jobs:` ‚Äì defines a job named `test` that uses a Docker container.
- `docker:` ‚Äì uses Python 3.10 container from CircleCI.
- `steps:` ‚Äì what CircleCI does inside the container:
  - `checkout` ‚Äì clones your GitHub repo.
  - Creates a virtual environment, installs pip + dependencies.
  - Runs all unit tests using `unittest discover`.
- `workflows:` ‚Äì defines what jobs run and in which order. Here we run just the `test` job.

---

## üöÄ Connecting to CircleCI

1. Push the code to GitHub.
2. Go to [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), sign in with GitHub.
3. Allow CircleCI GitHub App to access your repo.
4. CircleCI will auto-detect `.circleci/config.yml`.
5. On every push, CircleCI will run your tests!

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

You now have:
- A simple Python app.
- Automated testing on every push using CircleCI.
- GitHub App integration for secure and easy setup.

You can extend this by adding linting, code formatting, or deployment.
